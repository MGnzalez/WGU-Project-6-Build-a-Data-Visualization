# WGU-Project-6-Build-a-Tableau-Visualization

## Project Description

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Dataset 

Flight Delays and Cancellations

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

You are required to create three visualizations. As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.

## Reminders

Your visualization work should use Tableau: other visualization tools may not be evaluated by reviewers. Host your dashboards/stories on Tableau Public, you'll be submitting them to reviewers and this makes them easily accessible.

Remember that your visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.
